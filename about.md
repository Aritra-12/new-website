excerpt: Data Analyst turned Software Engineer, loves to create and reflect on life.

I'm a data analyst turned full-stack software engineer with a penchant for creative activities. Having studied quantitative economics, I graduated from college working in data analytics but found myself increasingly drawn towards the aspects of my role that involved code. As someone who likes to create, I loved the idea of being able to write code and see something tangible being built. As a person who values learning very deeply, I also loved the idea of having the opportunity to always learn something new. Fast-forward two years later, I excitedly announced to my close friends and family that I was going to teach myself web development by doing the #100DaysOfCode challenge. Eight months after that, I got my first real programming role as a Junior Software Engineer!

My writing is a compilation of technical articles and how-tos, life reflections, and general updates about what I'm up to in life. I am an avid recorder through words because I love being able to look back and see how much I have learned, grown, and changed. I don't, however, write solely for myself. I also write for other early career developers starting their journey who want to see the process others are going through to learn new things. I also write for first-generation college students who want more insight into navigating the world post-graduation. I also write for my triplet sisters who often want to know what I'm up to (we're really close and I'm very grateful). And I write for you! Thank you for taking the time to check out my site and reading!
