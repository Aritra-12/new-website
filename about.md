I'm a data analyst turned full-stack software engineer with a penchant for creative activities. I graduated from college with a degree in quantitative analytics and worked in data analytics, but I found myself increasingly drawn towards the aspects of my role that involved code. As someone who likes to create, I loved the idea of being able to write code and see something tangible being built. Also, as a person who values learning very deeply, I loved the idea of having the opportunity to always learn something new. I decided then to learn web development by doing the #100DaysOfCode challenge and slowly transitioned my way into software engineering.
