## About Me

I am a first-generation college graduate of San Diego State University. I am the daughter of Vietnamese refugees. I am a triplet. I am a runner. I am a Sufjan-Stevens enthusiast. I am a creator- and I *love* to create things with code.

My professional and academic experiences have included projects relating to the environment, wifi on airplanes, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/tranjanessa/home/lorenzanimations">visualizing multi-dimensional data</a>, analyzing trends in e-commerce, <a href="https://github.com/janessatran/beatlesmusicanalysis/blob/master/JanessaTranMLRPaper.pdf">understanding what drives popularity in certain songs by The Beatles</a>, among other topics.

Currently, I am a full-stack Junior Software Engineer at Ten Forward Consulting.

On a personal note, I love reading non-fiction, meditation, yoga, and my cat. His name is Lloyd and I named [this jekyll theme](https://github.com/janessatran/laloyd) after him if you're interested in checking it out and using it!

If you'd like to connect, I'm on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/janessatran_), [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/janessatran), [GitHub](https://github.com/janessatran), [Dev.to](https://dev.to/janessatran)
