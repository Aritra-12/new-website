My name is Janessa. I'm a software engineer who specializes in full-stack web applications with a bit of mobile applications sprinkled in. My pronouns are she/hers. I'm a triplet.

## OK, but who am I really?
- I love to make things and care little about the tools and a lot about the final product. 
- I love meeting new people, but I'm kind of introverted so I tend to talk a ton at the beginning of a new relationship and then seemingly dissapear (I like to recharge alone).
- I love banana chips maybe a little too much.
- I love being active: running, hiking, yoga, strength training, walking... As Sufjan would say, "Keep it moving!"
- I love music and play the guitar sometimes.

## My Values
Growth, open-mindedness, simplicity, and compassion.
